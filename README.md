This is an official repository for **Minimal Data Requirement for Realistic Endoscopic Image Generation with Stable Diffusion**.

## Overview
This repository provides resources and workflows for generating realistic endoscopic images using Stable Diffusion. The methodology is divided into four key steps:

1. **Training**  
   Train Stable Diffusion for endoscopic image generation.  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Prepare raw simulation images for inference.  
3. **Inference**  
   Generate realistic endoscopic images using the trained model.  
4. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the quality and realism of the generated images.

Each step has a detailed README in its respective folder.
