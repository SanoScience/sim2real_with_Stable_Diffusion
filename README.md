# sim2real_with_Stable_Diffusion

This is a code for "Minimal Data Requirement for Realistic Endoscopic Image Generation with Stable Diffusion".

We divided the forkflow in 4 steps:
1. Training
2. Preprocessing - for raw simulation images, step before Inference
3. Inference
4. Evaluation

Each step has it's own README file so please refer to it.
